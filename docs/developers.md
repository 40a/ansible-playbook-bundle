# How to create an ansibleapp project

### Directory layout of an ansibleapp
```
AnsibleApplication/
    Dockerfile
    ansibleapp/
        actions/
            provision.yaml
            deprovision.yaml
            bind.yaml
            unbind.yaml
```

These playbooks are called when their respective action is passed into the ansibleapp meta container. 

##### provision.yaml

This playbook should contain all tasks necessary to launch your application, including launching the containers and all configuration of services/routes/etc that are necessary for your application to work. If you used ansible-container to create your projects, the playbook generated by the shipit command should be sufficient.


##### deprovision.yaml

This playbook should contain all tasks necessary to tear down your application. In the majority of cases, this will be a single task that destroys the project, which will result in the deletion of all associated containers, services, and routes.

##### bind.yaml

TODO

##### unbind.yaml

TODO

### Example Dockerfile
```
FROM ansibleapp/ansibleapp-base

MAINTAINER Dylan Murray <dymurray@redhat.com>

ADD ansibleapp/actions /ansibleapp/actions
```

This Dockerfile is based off ansibleapp/ansibleapp-base which has an entrypoint script which will call the respective playbook out of /ansibleapp/actions/ as well as handling authentication.

Running an Ansibleapp
```
docker run -e "OPENSHIFT_TARGET=<oc_cluster_address>" -e "OPENSHIFT_USER=<oc_user>" -e "OPENSHIFT_PASS=<oc_pass>" <ansibleapp_name> $action
ex: docker run -e "OPENSHIFT_TARGET=cap.example.com:8443" -e "OPENSHIFT_USER=admin" -e "OPENSHIFT_PASS=admin" ansibleapp/etherpad-ansibleapp provision
```
